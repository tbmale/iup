//Cells creates a grid widget (set of cells) that enables several application-specific drawing,
//such as: chess tables, tiles editors, degrade scales, drawable spreadsheets and so forth.
//
//This element is mostly based on application callbacks functions that determine the number of cells (rows and columns),
//their appearance and interaction. This mechanism offers full flexibility to applications,
//but requires programmers attention to avoid infinite loops inside this functions.
//Using callbacks, cells can be also grouped to form major or hierarchical elements, such as headers, footers etc.
//This callback approach was intentionally chosen to allow all cells to be dynamically and directly
//changed based on application's data structures. Since the size of each cell is given by the application
//the size of the control also must be given using SIZE or RASTERSIZE attributes.

//ColorBrowser creates an element for selecting a color. The selection is done using a cylindrical projection of the RGB cube.
//The transformation defines a coordinate color system called HSI, that is still the RGB color space but using cylindrical coordinates.

//H is for Hue, and it is the angle around the RGB cube diagonal starting at red (RGB=255 0 0).
//
//S is for Saturation, and it is the normal distance from the color to the diagonal, normalized by its maximum value at the specified Hue.
//This also defines a point at the diagonal used to define I.
//
//I is for Intensity, and it is the distance from the point defined at the diagonal to black (RGB=0 0 0).
//I can also be seen as the projection of the color vector onto the diagonal. But I is not linear, see Notes below.
